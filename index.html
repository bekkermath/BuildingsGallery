	This website hosts the Buildings Gallery web application, which will continuously be developed.</br></br>
	
	The buildings of type A2 belong to the groups SL(3,F), type A3 to SL(4,F). For spherical, buildings
	indicated with the prefix Sph, F is the field of order two. The affine building, indicated with the prefix
	Aff, F is the 2-adic field (or actually the rationals with the 2-adic valuation).</br></br>
	
	The building admits an action by its respective group such that the fundamental chamber is stabilized by
	the standard Borel subgroup. Each chamber is stabilised by a conjugate of the standard Borel subgroup,
	given by a canonical element of the form "u s". Here "u" is a product of unitary upper triangular matrices
	and "s" is a permutation matrix, presented in term of the simple reflections s1, s2 and s3.
	Other simplices, e.g. lines and points, correspond to unions of these Borel subgroups, and thus the buildings
	show the entire structure of the parabolic subgroups of each group.
	(Formally all of this happens over an algebraic group, but ofcourse we can only show F-points here).</br></br>
	
	Rotate the view with the left mouse button, zoom with the scroll wheel and drag the camera by clicking and dragging
	the middle mouse button/scroll button. Vertices can be dragged with left click (although they have a small
	hitbox).</br></br>
	
	Combinatorial n-spheres around the fundamental chamber are displayed by the different colours. The fundamental
	apartment is opaque. Change the radius up to which the chambers are displayed with the slider. Hovering over a
	chamber displays the canonical representative element for the stabilizer of the chamber.</br></br>
	
	If you are experience performance issues, reduce the display radius of the building.
